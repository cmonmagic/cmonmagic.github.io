Here's a short summary of (hopefully) all of the practical information you might want/need to attend the C'mon! Katowice 2025:

### Before the tournament

- Please make sure that you went through the [registration process](https://cmonmagic.pl/blog/tickets-on-sale-for-spodek) for Saturday Main event, Sunday Trio, or both (no pre-registration is required for any of the side-events). At the end of a successful registration, you should be able to log into your [Melee](https://melee.gg/) account (previously existing, or a new one, created at the email address pointed in the form), and see yourself enrolled in the tournament(s). If you don't, please contact us immediately at: [support@cmonmagic.pl](mailto:support@cmonmagic.pl)
- Once you log into Melee, please upload the decklist for each of the up to two major events. Please, - if possible - do that before the event, to make sure we avoid unnecessary delays on the day of the tournament. Paper decklists are neither required or accepted.

### Coming into the venue

- Venue is located in the northern part of the city center, and thus is very well communicated. We can highly recommend getting there by a public transport (just aim at "Spodek", e.g. in [jakdojade](https://jakdojade.pl/katowice)), especially that in parallel to the board games convention (these tournaments are part of), there are additional city [anniversary events](https://miasto-ogrodow.eu/strona/kochamkatowice_2025) planned for the weekend.
- Should you decide to drive to the event by car, please be aware that on Saturday, parking on some of the area around the venue (blue area on the map below) requires paying [city fees](https://parkowanie.katowice.eu/oplaty-i-kontrole). On Sunday street/public parking is free throughout the city. We could recommend looking for a parking spot west of the venue (pink-ish area on the map) first, and - would that be impossible - going further west to the parking of "Silesia City Center" mall, and coming to the venue by tram.

### Entering the venue

#### Where:

C'mon Katowice takes place in a Conference Center next to the "Spodek" hall, in collaboration with the "Plansz√≥wki w Spodku" board games convention (ticket to any of the C'mon! main events allows also to enter the convention on that day!). Once in the building, go to the tournaments zone and you're all set.

#### When:

We do gather at the main [entrance to the building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UbLy4gsmokPvvMiMA) at **9:00 AM on Saturday**. Please make sure you're there on time. Please do NOT stand in the queue to the main event (participants of the tournament can enter the building early), but rather look for a group of fellow pauperians standing near the main entry.

#### What to take with you:

Bands are going to all the preregistered participants by name. Just in case, you can take your ID with you, but no paper or electronic ticket is required to get the band. Once you get the band, you can enter/leave the building at will.

### Afterparty

- Just like last year, the afterparty will take place at the [Emcek Bistro](https://emcekbistro.pl) located in the building, next to the main entrance

### Timeline - Saturday

NOTE: on players' request, we're aiming at starting the Trio a bit ahead of the original schedule (originally planned for 10:00). Teams have to be fully registered in melee, and at least their capitain present on site at the start time
